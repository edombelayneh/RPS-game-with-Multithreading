- Depending on the floor (on the level) the number of Zombies increases and time decreases. There are four objects a player can collect:
  - **A Key:** 3 keys are on each floor, each key needs to be collected before the time runs out. 
  - **A Brain:** gives user more time (considering that zombies love eating brain :))
  - **A Syringe:** gives user more health and therefore more time.
  - **A Rotten Apple:** gives user less life (less health) and less time.
